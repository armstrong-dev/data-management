# ARMSTRONG project database

## Directories
`pdf`: Save `pdf` files in this directory.

`json`: Save `json` files in this directory (see `json` format rules below).

## Naming convention
Use a UUID generator, e.g. https://www.uuidgenerator.net/, to generate a 32-digit string (remove '-'). Add necessary extension.

## `json` format
See a general description of the `json` format at https://www.json.org/. In the ARMSTRONG database a `json` file is as a metafile for a database object. It should have the same name as the object (see Naming convention) and extensjio `.json`.
